## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### 1️⃣ **Wrong Variant Selection** (60 cases - 71.4% of failures)

**Primary Issue**: System selects completely different clinical scenarios

**Examples**:
- **Original**: "Adult. Surveillance postpituitary or sellar mass resection"
- **Selected**: "Adult female. Adnexal mass, likely benign, no acute symptoms"
- **Impact**: Brain imaging → Pelvic imaging (completely wrong anatomy)

**Root Causes**:
- Semantic similarity matching fails for complex medical terminology
- Cross-anatomical confusion (brain vs pelvis, chest vs abdomen)
- Clinical stage confusion (initial vs follow-up vs surveillance)

### 2️⃣ **Imaging vs Treatment Mismatch** (2 cases - 2.4% of failures)

**Primary Issue**: Correct variant selected but wrong procedure type

**Examples**:
- **DVT Case**: Expected "Anticoagulation" (treatment) → Got "Doppler Ultrasound" (imaging)
- **Breast Screening**: Expected "Digital breast tomosynthesis screening" → Got "Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)"

**Root Causes**:
- ACR database contains both imaging and treatment procedures
- System bias towards imaging procedures
- Insufficient context understanding of clinical intent

### 3️⃣ **Partial Matches** (22 cases - 26.2% of failures)

**Primary Issue**: Some procedures correct, others missed or extra

**Examples**:
- **Seizure Case**: Got 1/2 procedures (CT but missed MRI)
- **Aneurysm Case**: Got 2/2 correct + 2 extra procedures

**Root Causes**:
- Incomplete procedure sets in ACR variants
- Over-prediction (system suggests more than needed)
- Under-prediction (system misses secondary procedures)

## 📈 Similarity Score Analysis

### Perfect Cases vs Failures:
- **Perfect Cases**: Mean similarity = 0.879 (range: 0.760-0.975)
- **Failure Cases**: Mean similarity = 0.844 (range: 0.723-0.970)

### Key Insights:
1. **High Similarity ≠ Success**: 9 cases with >0.9 similarity still failed
2. **Low Similarity = Failure**: 13 cases with <0.8 similarity all failed
3. **Overlap Zone**: Many failures occur in 0.8-0.9 similarity range

## 🚨 Critical Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Anatomical Cross-Contamination
- Brain conditions → Pelvic imaging
- Chest conditions → Abdominal procedures
- **Solution**: Anatomical constraint in variant matching

### Pattern 2: Clinical Stage Confusion
- Initial imaging → Follow-up procedures
- Surveillance → Active treatment
- **Solution**: Temporal context understanding

### Pattern 3: Imaging vs Treatment Bias
- Treatment needed → Imaging suggested
- **Solution**: Procedure type classification

### Pattern 4: Procedure Granularity Issues
- Generic terms vs specific procedures
- "Ultrasound" vs "US pelvis transvaginal"
- **Solution**: Procedure name standardization

## 💡 Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Enhanced Variant Matching**
- Add anatomical region constraints
- Implement clinical stage awareness
- Use multi-stage similarity scoring

### 2. **Procedure Type Classification**
- Separate imaging vs treatment pathways
- Add clinical intent detection
- Context-aware procedure selection

### 3. **Quality Thresholds**
- Set minimum similarity thresholds (>0.85)
- Implement confidence scoring
- Add human-in-the-loop for low confidence cases

### 4. **Data Quality Improvements**
- Standardize procedure naming conventions
- Ensure complete procedure sets per variant
- Add procedure type metadata
